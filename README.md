## üöÄ Project Overview

The **AI Services Toolkit Pro** is a powerful and versatile application designed to provide a suite of advanced AI capabilities through a user-friendly web interface. It leverages a high-performance FastAPI backend to host various machine learning models and a responsive Streamlit frontend for seamless user interaction. The application is containerized using Docker, making it highly portable and easy to deploy on platforms like Hugging Face Spaces.

This toolkit allows users to perform tasks such as:

* **Sentiment Analysis:** Understand the emotional tone of text.
* **Text Summarization:** Condense long documents into concise summaries.
* **Creative Text Generation:** Generate new text based on a given prompt.
* **Image Captioning:** Create descriptive captions for uploaded images.
* **Language Translation:** Translate text from English to French.
* **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Convert written text into natural-sounding speech.
* **Speech-to-Text (STT):** Transcribe spoken audio into written text.
* **AI Chatbot:** Engage in a conversational dialogue with an AI assistant.
* **Question Answering (Mock):** Get answers to questions (currently a mock feature, ready for real model integration).
